	<h4>About Us</h4>

	Web content is the reason that people come to your Web pages. But many Web designers and Web developers forget this in their rush to create the prettiest page or the most interesting architecture or the best interaction. When it comes right down to it, customers are not interested in whether your design has a 3-pixel or a 5-pixel bevel. They don't care that you've built it in Drupal. And they just want the interactivity to work and not get in the way.
